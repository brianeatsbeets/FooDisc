# FooDisc
FooDisc is a personal replication of UDisc to test out new ideas and features for future projects.

This project came about as a fun way to test and display my skills in exploring new frameworks in iOS. This was my first foray into MapKit, and I had a lot of fun seeing everything come together. That being said, the to-do list is long - this will be an ongoing project, and I'm excited to refine it and continue to add new features as I think of them. Below are some of the features, frameworks, and methodologies used in the project:

- UI/navigation elements
  - Navigation controller
  - TabView controller
  - MapViews, Annotations, and AnnotationViews
  - TableView controllers with static and dynamic cells
  - Custom TableView cells
  - Autolayout
  - Stack views
  - IBOutlets, IBOutletCollections, and IBActions
  - System controllers
    - UIAlertController
    - UIImagePickerController
    - UIColorPickerViewController
- Swift coding elements
  - MVC design pattern
  - Delegation
  - Dependency injection
  - Frequent and descriptive comments
  - Persistent data via UserDefaults, Documents directory plist (Firebase integration soon)
    - Conforming to Codable protocol
